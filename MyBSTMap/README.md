I self-study data structure using material from this course presented by University of California, Berkeley.

In this project I implemented a BST-based (Binary Search Tree) map which runs in O(log N) time.

 I finished this project as instructed all by myself, with limited skeleton code as provided. In order for this project to run properly, import Javalib as library.
