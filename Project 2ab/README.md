I self-study data structure using material from this course presented by University of California, Berkeley.

This project is call "Project 2AB: Extrinsic PQ and KDTree". Basically I implemented this two basic data structures from scratch, and tested it that it runs.

 I finished this project as instructed all by myself, with limited skeleton code as provided. In order for this project to run properly, import Javalib as library.
